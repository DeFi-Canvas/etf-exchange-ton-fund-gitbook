# Asset Selection Methodology

We take a meticulous approach to selecting assets for our fund. Our main criteria include:

- **Stability**: We choose assets that demonstrate resilience in the market.
- **Growth Potential**: Our team analyzes the growth prospects of each cryptocurrency or stock to include only the most promising assets.
- **Diversification**: We aim to include assets from various sectors of the cryptocurrency market to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of stable growth.

### Example:
- If a project shows steady progress in development, a solid TVL, trading volumes, and is supported by a strong development team, it may be included in our fund. This way, you don’t need to track the market yourself — we do it for you.
