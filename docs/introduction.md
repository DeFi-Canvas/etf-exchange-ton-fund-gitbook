# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the [DeFi Canvas](https://t.me/DeFiCanvas) project. We provide access to digital financial products such as deposits, loans, liquidity provision, exchanges, and investments in various indices.

We aim to offer services to a wide range of participants, for example:
- **Beginners** will have access to a simple app for investing without the need for a crypto wallet.
- **Experienced investors** can utilize advanced tools.
- **Institutional participants** can create complex strategies.

Our goal is to simplify the investment process, making the world of cryptocurrencies easier, clearer, and more accessible for everyone.
