# How to Invest in Indices

### Before Investing
An index is a pre-assembled "basket" consisting of assets in specific proportions. On the index page, you can find details such as: description, composition and proportions of assets, selection methodology, risk level, and service fees. Each index displays the value of its assets [TVL](glossary.md#tvl), its returns, as well as the amount of your investments and their results. You can also explore each asset in detail by clicking on its icon to access its dedicated page.

### What Happens When You Invest
When you contribute your assets to an index, they are automatically distributed according to the logic specified in the "What’s Inside" section, and you become a shareholder in that index. At any time, you can sell your share at the current market price.

When investing through your own wallet, i.e., [non-custodially](glossary.md#не-кастодиальное-хранение), our smart contract purchases assets on-chain according to the predefined logic, and in return, issues you an [LP token](glossary.md#лп-токен). You can freely exchange, transfer, or redeem this token without any restrictions.
