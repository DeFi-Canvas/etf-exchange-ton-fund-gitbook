# Risks and Recommendations

All investments carry risks, and we are no exception. It’s important to remember:

- **Risk of Loss**: The value of assets can fluctuate, which may lead to both gains and losses in your investments.
- **Market Instability**: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, so be prepared for price changes.
- **Long-Term Perspective**: Investments through indices are better viewed as long-term to minimize the impact of short-term fluctuations.
- **Counterparty Risks**: There is always a risk of errors from counterparties.
- **Smart Contract Risks**: While our smart contracts undergo thorough audits, even that cannot guarantee 100% protection against errors.

### Recommendations:
1. Only invest funds that you are prepared to lose.
2. Research the market and assets before investing.
3. Start with a small amount if you’re a beginner.
4. If you need a personalized solution, [contact us](contacts.md).
