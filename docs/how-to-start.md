# Getting Started

Open our [Telegram bot](https://t.me/DeFiCanvas_bot) and launch the application.

If you already have a crypto wallet, connect it by clicking the **Connect Wallet** button. If you don’t have a crypto wallet, you can create one by following [the instructions](instructions.md#создание-кошелька). If you prefer not to create one, we can set it up for you and securely store it — this is called [custodial storage](glossary.md#кастодиальное-хранение).

On the main screen, you will find information about your custodial wallet:
- Balance
- List of assets
- Index tab
- Transaction history
- Portfolio analytics
- Favorites

Available features include:
- Deposit
- Withdrawal
- Swap
- Index investments

You can fund your wallet by clicking [Deposit](how-to-deposit.md). After that, you can exchange funds for other assets using the [Swap](how-to-swap.md) button or start investing in indices with a single click through the [Index](how-to-invest-index.md) tab.

**P.S.** The project is currently in test mode, and some features may not be available.
