# Frequency asked questions (FAQ)

**Is it safe to invest in the Fund?**
The Fund aims to provide stable yields, but returns depend on market conditions and the performance of the underlying blockchain protocols. While we focus on optimizing returns, past performance does not guarantee future results, and profits may fluctuate. As with any investment, risks are involved, including potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts and counterparty instability.

**How much profit will I make?**
The returns are influenced by market dynamics and the success of the protocols we invest in. While our objective is to achieve stable yields, we cannot guarantee any specific profit level. Historical performance should not be taken as an indication of future gains.

**How can I withdraw money?**
"There are no restrictions on withdrawals. You can sell your fund position at any time without penalties."
