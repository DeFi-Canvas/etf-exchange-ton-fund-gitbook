# How to Start Investing

Getting started with our fund is very simple. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. **Connect your Telegram account** in our bot.
2. **Link your wallet** using the integrated Telegram Wallet, TonKeeper, or TonHub.
3. **Choose a fund**: Select the fund that interests you.
4. **Select an asset and specify the amount**: You don’t need to invest a large amount right away — you can start with a small sum and any asset, even HMST.
5. **Confirm the transaction**: After confirmation, your funds will automatically be allocated across the ETF assets, and in return, you will receive a receipt token.

After this, you will become a shareholder in our fund and can monitor changes in the value of your assets through our application.
