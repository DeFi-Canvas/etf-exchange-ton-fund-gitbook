# How to Deposit

### For funding a custodial wallet:
- Click **"Deposit"**
- Select the asset you wish to deposit
- Copy the wallet identifier (address)

In the platform you are sending from, enter the copied identifier and complete the transfer. The assets should arrive within a few minutes, and your wallet balance will be updated automatically upon receipt.

### For a non-custodial wallet:
Simply connect your wallet.
